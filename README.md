# PowerApps Project Presentation: Data Integration for a Proof of Concept (PoC)

When integrating data into a PowerApps application, there are several solutions available. However, for a Proof of Concept (PoC) that we intend to share, the options become somewhat limited. Here are the primary solutions we can utilize:

1. **Insert an Excel file directly into the app**
2. **Store JSON data in one or more environment variables**
3. **Integrate data directly within the app**
4. **Utilize JSON hosted on GitHub**

## Focus on Option 4: Utilizing JSON Hosted on GitHub

In this presentation, I will discuss the fourth option: leveraging JSON files hosted on GitHub. This method provides numerous advantages:

- **Ease of Remapping**: The location of the files can be easily changed without disrupting the application. 
- **Editability**: JSON files hosted on GitHub can be edited directly, making it simple to update the data as needed.
- **Sharing**: Sharing these files is straightforward, allowing for easy collaboration among team members.

## Architectural Considerations

The proposed architecture indicates that the application will be premium. Fortunately, this will not pose a problem within your development environment, allowing you to effectively leverage all the capabilities of PowerApps.

In conclusion, utilizing JSON hosted on GitHub for data integration in a PowerApps PoC is a practical choice that enhances flexibility, ease of use, and collaborative features, making it an ideal solution for your application development needs.

## Flow to get JSON

As you can see it's a really simple flow
